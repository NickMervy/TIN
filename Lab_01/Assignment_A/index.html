		<mark>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
			<u>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, </u>
			when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
			specimen book. </mark>
	</p>
	<p>
		<br>It has survived not only five centuries,</br> but also the leap into
		electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <big>It was popularised in
			the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, </big>
		and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
		versions of Lorem Ipsum.
